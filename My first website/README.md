This is a Asp.Net Core website done in visual studio code in C#. It's a database type project(a library database) with the basic CRUD operations.

This folder containes the full project as zip and the main code (if you would like just to view it and not check functionality) .
The database for the username/password and books was created separately using Microsoft SQL Server.
